# jacobsHack2018##Inspiration - To provide a convenient form of interaction for people who are not really comfortable working with computer interface##What it does- It uses Natural Language to interact with users. It asks the users what kind of travel options they are looking for, and gives them the most relevant options extracted from the API of SkyScanner.##How we built-We used DialogFlow by Google to program the voice assistant that works on multiple platforms. In this case, we were working with Google Assistant.##Challenges we ran into- Fetching data from the API of SkyScanner to Google Cloud Base, using asynchronous fetch functionsWe eventually found a hack to make the fetch functions asynchronous, and we were also able to fetch required data from API of SkyScanner.##What we learned- We learned that multiple lines of coding can be a bit messy sometimes, and we need to play around the codes patiently to figure out what works the best.  And, working in a team always helps to solve these problems efficiently.##What's next for travel guide: For now, we have just programmed the flight options, but haven't implemented booking options yet. So, we can extend the features of this project by adding on the booking options, and also extending the transport options to trains, buses, cars, etc.
